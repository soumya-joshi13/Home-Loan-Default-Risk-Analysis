# Home-Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis
Analysis of home loan default risk using Python to identify key factors influencing loan repayment behavior.

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze home loan data and identify key factors that influence loan default risk. The insights aim to support better credit risk assessment and informed lending decisions.

## Problem Statement
Home loan defaults pose significant financial risk to lending institutions. Understanding customer attributes and loan characteristics that contribute to default can help banks reduce risk while maintaining healthy loan portfolios.

## Dataset Overview
- Loan applicant demographic and financial information
- Target variable: Loan Default (Yes / No)
- Features include income, loan amount, credit history, employment details, and property attributes

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature-level risk analysis
- Insight-driven interpretation focused on business impact

## Key Insights
- Certain income and credit history segments show higher default risk
- Loan amount and repayment capacity strongly influence default behavior
- Employment stability plays a key role in loan repayment

## Business Recommendations
- Strengthen credit checks for high-risk segments
- Adjust loan approval criteria based on risk indicators
- Use risk-based pricing or additional verification for borderline cases

## Project Artifacts
- Python Notebook: `python/Home_Loan_Default.ipynb`
- Final Report: `reports/Home_Loan_Default_Final_Report.pdf`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates analytical thinking applied to a real-world banking problem, translating data insights into actionable credit risk recommendations.
